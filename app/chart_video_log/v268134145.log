[1:38:38] <ujds0012star> UTD! Y‚Äôall did great!!!! Keep going!!!!!!!!
[1:38:45] <MyNameIsMatt> well it looks pretty gay
[1:38:51] <+AlphaRL_> idk UTD are not affiliated with college carball. this is the first we are seeing of them
[1:38:51] <ujds0012star> Awesome game!!!!!
[1:39:09] <raulduke21> oh I was confused with the best of four up there. I was like what?
[1:39:11] <jluv22> you're mom is pretty gay
[1:39:14] <+AlphaRL_> i predicted a UT sweep too mate
[1:39:18] <+IanGonzalez6> REEEEEEEEEEE
[1:39:20] <+AlphaRL_> i wrote the scripts
[1:39:25] <kuroneko334> NotLikeThis
[1:39:26] <raulduke21> i get it now
[1:39:29] <DumbGiant> Doodat is an adorable little Asian boi
[1:39:32] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> are they playing another one? there can't even be a tie anymore
[1:39:33] <DumbGiant> So cute
[1:39:34] <YoMonroe> Its scripted? LUL
[1:39:42] <+isee35> It says best of 4 at the top but they mean Best of 7 lol. or Race to 4
[1:39:42] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> is there points per game won?
[1:39:46] <+AlphaRL_> üëèüëèüëè4-game series. round robin feeding into a single elim bracket.
[1:39:46] <+9hyd> 3-0 up after 0 seconds LUL
[1:40:03] <+nachosrule2> should be first to 4
[1:40:10] <+Jamesiae> !bracket
[1:40:12] <+AlphaRL_> thats best of 7
[1:40:15] <+WhitebarkRL> No it's not first to 4
[1:40:21] <+WhitebarkRL> It's a 4 game series
[1:40:28] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> so there must be points per game won right then
[1:40:29] <+WhitebarkRL> No matter how many either team wins
[1:40:32] <+AlphaRL_> whitebaek i love you
[1:40:34] <raulduke21> its just who wins in 4 games that's it
[1:40:59] <+IanGonzalez6> IT IS FIRST TO 4 WINS
[1:41:03] <+9hyd> Bit of a fiesta there LUL
[1:41:04] <+WhitebarkRL> Then the number of games won determines seeding for a single elim between the 4 teams
[1:41:05] <+IanGonzalez6> IN OTHER WORDS, BEST OF 7
[1:41:09] <+WhitebarkRL> NO
[1:41:12] <jgb033> that mask hiding shame
[1:41:13] <+9hyd> XD
[1:41:17] <+Raighar> xD
[1:41:18] <Evxzzion> What a save!
[1:41:20] <YoMonroe> its not BO7
[1:41:25] <+AlphaRL_> games are tallied over 2 matches for the teams to determine seeds feeding into a single elimination
[1:41:27] <+isee35> oh got it - It is a best of 4
[1:41:33] <kuroneko334> the a/c air in the building is too toxic
[1:41:34] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> is it best of 9 then?
[1:41:35] <+9hyd> 4 games played. win 3, win the series, get 3 points. win 2 each, tie the series, get 1 point.
[1:41:37] <+PokaLXIV> boiSREGGOP
[1:41:38] <+AlphaRL_> all teams need to play the same amount to do that properly
[1:41:44] <+IanGonzalez6> OK, SO IT IS LIKE OVERWATCH LEAGUE
[1:41:46] <+IanGonzalez6> GOT IT
[1:41:47] <+OceansAwait> It should say best of 7 but these people need help in life
[1:41:47] <raulduke21> yea 4 games if they split they split that's it
[1:41:51] <+JimmithyPuffin> the collective IQ of this chat is about 14
[1:41:56] <DumbGiant> Ur moms like overwatch league
[1:42:02] <+GarfyTheCat> What a save! Chat disabled for 3 seconds.
[1:42:03] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> but why are they playing another at 3-0 then?
[1:42:06] <stresstest> 14 is not too bad , right ? ;)
[1:42:07] <+Corelli> POGGERS
[1:42:07] <+AlphaRL_> it should say "4-game series"
[1:42:12] <YoMonroe> its basically like a battle royale

[1:42:16] <+9hyd> @CallOfBootyCrackOps Seeding I think

[1:42:29] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> oh ok so it's a best of 9 got it
[1:42:32] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> first to 5 ok
[1:42:33] <+frzblitz> why have these weird ass split, couldnt they just play 5 games so you always get a winner
[1:42:37] <+WhitebarkRL> It's not first to win 4 athREE athREE athREE athREE athREE
[1:42:44] <DumbGiant> @corelli yo you got some of the thiccest legs I ever done gone seen. Lemme smash
[1:42:48] <+AlphaRL_> all the teams need to have an 8-game record to determine seeds for single elimination
[1:42:52] <+GarfyTheCat> @WhitebarkRL is it best of 7 then? Kappa LUL
[1:42:56] <MyNameIsMatt> @WhitebarkRL someone asid that fooyaREE fooyaREE fooyaREE fooyaREE fooyaREE fooyaREE
[1:42:57] <+AlphaRL_> there are only four teams in this
[1:43:05] <+Corelli> DumbGiant excuse me?

[1:43:34] <raulduke21> true yea
[1:43:39] <stevenmacca> No bracket
[1:43:48] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> so basically there is no series and they are just playing each other 4 times in a row
[1:43:52] <+CallOfBootyCrackOps> then it goes by record
[1:43:55] <+frzblitz> UT!!!
[1:44:03] <Evster59> doodat for president
[1:44:06] <+WhitebarkRL> yea then they seed a bracket based on games won

[2:37:02] <GoodOleJimmyG> lmao
[2:37:03] <loosecannon33> @SodasRightBallsack going for some low chance hits up field or things you might not hit everytime can force the defenders to stay grounded in case you make the touch
[2:37:16] <SodasRightBallsack> Thats true actually
[2:37:22] <spacepirate_> How close is the tournament to finals?
[2:37:24] <+AlphaRL_> diamond 3 teams arnt outside of the best 80 collegiate teams out there
[2:37:28] <+weerdjai> How long until the duos tournament?
[2:37:35] <Dampeerr> Kronovi still the best at this game ?
[2:37:39] <+WhitebarkRL> no
[2:37:42] <+natedashef> Is there a cash prize?
[2:37:48] <jorolelin> No, Johnsandman is better CoolCat

[2:38:38] <+WhitebarkRL> Kro is still near the top of the pro scene. He just isn't the best anymore
[2:38:52] <jorolelin> @WhitebarkRL it's b/c jonsandman is better right
[2:38:56] <+WhitebarkRL> yea
[2:38:57] <Dampeerr> Ah gotcha
[2:38:57] <SodasRightBallsack> I hope DreamHack haven't read the chat sodaFINN
[2:38:58] <GoodOleJimmyG> this is so painful to watch just finish the game jeez
[2:39:02] <jorolelin> hes my favorite pro <3
[2:39:07] <+natedashef> Imagine getting your balls dragged in chat and you still don‚Äôt win anything

[2:40:26] <GoodOleJimmyG> on how tf you think I'm wrong
[2:40:43] <GoodOleJimmyG> he's the best 3rd man easily
[2:40:56] <Biscuit_rl> jimmy is mostly correct
[2:40:59] <jorolelin> Right
[2:41:08] <+PokaLXIV> fickle Kreygasm
[2:41:08] <jorolelin> I'm glad you know more about comp RL than me CoolCat

[2:42:08] <GoodOleJimmyG> @Sleepydog101 hes a phenom at goalkeeping and defense positioning, plus he can read whether or not he needs to commit for a shot and his passing and team understanding is outrageous
[2:42:12] <theannal> stick to breath of the wild UNT
[2:42:14] <+LosCochino> pubg??
[2:42:15] <+AlphaRL_> holy shit thats tony hawk

[2:42:42] <jorolelin> @Biscuit_rl I concur

[2:43:38] <+Sleepydog101> u good haha
[2:43:45] <tha_funnyplayzz007> i want 2 die SeriousSloth
[2:43:46] <GoodOleJimmyG> @sleepymtn hes a phenom at goalkeeping and defense positioning, plus he can read whether or not he needs to commit for a shot and his passing and team understanding is outrageous
[2:43:49] <GoodOleJimmyG> there we go
[2:44:05] <Biscuit_rl> torment i think is best goalie to counter in NA
[2:44:32] <GoodOleJimmyG> I disagree solely bc of kro has more experience and better team understanding
[2:44:34] <tha_funnyplayzz007> what is a torment?
[2:44:37] <sofi_sofa> so did the giveaway already happen?
[2:44:42] <GoodOleJimmyG> I think torment is marginally better mechanically
[2:44:47] <YoMonroe> Joro HeyGuys
[2:44:54] <YoMonroe> @jorolelin
[2:45:01] <jorolelin> y0
[2:45:08] <Biscuit_rl> agree to disagree :)
[2:45:10] <jorolelin> did u guys here? Kronovi the best third man on earth CoolCat
[2:45:15] <GoodOleJimmyG> agrred
[2:45:18] <+AlphaRL_> @jorolelin where are you going to college bro
[2:45:24] <YoMonroe> ^
[2:45:26] <+zmann> !
[2:45:36] <tha_funnyplayzz007> SeriousSloth SeriousSloth SeriousSloth SeriousSloth SeriousSloth
[2:45:39] <jorolelin> no idea m8 wherever I can get in for the cheapest :P
[2:45:49] <+9hyd> xrdblaDe
[2:45:56] <tha_funnyplayzz007> i want a dx racer
[2:46:34] <jorolelin> Anyway @GoodOleJimmyG I'd like to point out that torment is a way better third man than kronovi simply because kronovi literally isn't a third man. He is on one of the most balanced teams in north america where there aren't defined roles for the players, and you'll see him up as often as you see him back.
[2:46:46] <Biscuit_rl> the intermissions are ridic..
[2:46:47] <Bdawg8> @AlphaRL_ Hey boss
[2:46:50] <tha_funnyplayzz007> true
[2:47:11] <starklyy> i dont usually watch rocket league can someone explain what is captain/second man/third man?
[2:47:24] <GoodOleJimmyG> @jorolelin I understand that you are far more knowledgeable on this than me, I'm just giving my opinion on how I see it
[2:47:26] <+AlphaRL_> captain is leader
[2:47:40] <+AlphaRL_> second man is usually playmaker/finisher
[2:47:41] <Biscuit_rl> i can take naps inbetween games
[2:47:53] <+AlphaRL_> third man is last defense and clearer
[2:47:56] <tha_funnyplayzz007> second man just shadows
[2:47:59] <jorolelin> @starklyy Some teams prefer to have power duos on offense who understand each other well and do a good job of scoring goals, and naturally this leaves them to have a third, defensive minded player at the back
[2:48:26] <starklyy> i see ty
[2:48:27] <Bdawg8> Big rivalry here
[2:48:34] <+goodson345> is kronovi a third man?
[2:48:36] <jorolelin> Other teams have basically everyone play every role and so they don't have a third man
[2:48:42] <Bdawg8> CAMERACEPTION
[2:48:43] <tha_funnyplayzz007> one day ill play rlcs :p
[2:48:48] <jorolelin> I'd argue that kronovi isn't but I can see why some people would say that he is
[2:48:53] <+AlphaRL_> no kro is usually second man
[2:49:03] <starklyy> do they sit in order
[2:49:12] <+AlphaRL_> but as joro said, hes on one of the most balnced teams in the game. they rotate
[2:49:32] <Biscuit_rl> fairy peak is best 4th man in the bizz..
[2:49:48] <jorolelin> no, even on the teams with power duos and a third man, every player needs to rotate and be able to play every position
[2:49:58] <+PokaLXIV> littleboyW
[2:49:59] <tha_funnyplayzz007> yea

[2:55:39] <MysteriousPickleTV> How does a best of 4 work??
[2:55:48] <+AlphaRL_> *4-game series. round robin feeding into a single elim bracket.
[2:55:54] <+gabpelletier> @Asadon_ hes not playing this game
[2:55:57] <MysteriousPickleTV> Ah I see
[2:56:01] <lancemeter342> yo this is mad bro
[2:56:15] <+AlphaRL_> its not best of 4. AVGL just hasnt fixed the overlay
[2:56:22] <GoodOleJimmyG> @AlphaRL_ how many times have you answered that today lol
[2:56:25] <tha_funnyplayzz007> this gameplay is so bad
[2:56:30] <+AlphaRL_> 356327

[2:57:19] <+sleepymtn> Ya you get 3 points for winning the series and 1 point for a tie (2-2)
[2:57:20] <tha_funnyplayzz007> great clear
[2:57:39] <Enigma_Sector> What Rank are these guys?
[2:57:53] <notlordstinger> wadu
[2:57:58] <+sleepymtn> @Enigma_Sector Mostly GC in this tournament, not sure specifically about these teams
[2:58:00] <tha_funnyplayzz007> silver
[2:58:09] <+Raighar> PowerUpL xrdblaDe PowerUpR
[2:58:09] <Asadon_> @gabpelletier wadu hek! saving the best for last I guess
[2:58:32] <LBN_Gaming> looks like normal ranked games...
[2:58:38] <+jon_gee> LUL
[2:58:46] <+sk00b> dat boi XRD done it again
[2:58:50] <tha_funnyplayzz007> looks like diamond 2
[2:58:53] <+sk00b> someone sign him up
[2:58:59] <+Raighar> I want to have xrdblaDe 's babies
[2:58:59] <Enigma_Sector> Yeah doesn'
[2:59:08] <Enigma_Sector> Doesn't look like GC
[2:59:18] <tha_funnyplayzz007> yea
[2:59:27] <Asadon_> @DreamHack best of 4?
[2:59:28] <MysteriousPickleTV> Everyone in this lobby is a GC, I checked RLTracker
[2:59:41] <+sleepymtn> That's probably because you expect most GC play to look like RLCS. But this is more low GC and there is a huge difference between these guys and the pros
[2:59:44] <+Bboykidd10> It‚Äôs like watching solo standard
[2:59:48] <+9hyd> xrdblaDe 's one in the last series was better Kappa
[2:59:50] <+SixEighth> I mean, if y'all go to college then by all means. Make a team and qualify for these tournies.
[2:59:51] <+stealthninja373> lets go UT
[3:00:02] <LBN_Gaming> maybe all 6 players just got a bad game Kappa
[3:00:02] <tha_funnyplayzz007> nah more cuz i play GC
[3:00:04] <Asadon_> UNT!!!!
[3:00:13] <+gabpelletier> @Asadon_ right??
[3:00:14] <+AlphaRL_> üëèüëèüëè*4-game series. round robin feeding into a single elim bracket.
[3:00:42] <MysteriousPickleTV> What @sleepymtn said, the skill gap between low GC and top 100 is about as big as platinum to champion
[3:00:45] <+AlphaRL_> if youre looking for teams, join college carball
[3:00:49] <+hippiehank> who‚Äôs at txst and wants to start a team
[3:00:55] <+AlphaRL_> 120 chapters and counting
[3:01:20] <+AlphaRL_> and i believe texas state has one already
[3:01:22] <+9hyd> Fro > Cap
[3:01:28] <tha_funnyplayzz007> but man .... this looks lik diamond idk
[3:01:32] <+AlphaRL_> or one in development at least
[3:01:37] <+jawewe_> go UT
[3:01:54] <+hippiehank> oh sweet i‚Äôll check that out lol
[3:01:57] <MysteriousPickleTV> Could be the pressure of the big stage idk, but they do look rusty ngl

[3:04:07] <MysteriousPickleTV> Usually not as smoothly as that, there‚Äôs more luck involved in diamond lol

[4:04:18] <+fcRL> !bracket
[4:04:21] <Cryo_RL> If your wondering...Apache doesn‚Äôt play for Apache Esports
[4:04:33] <+AlphaRL_> what's that
[4:04:39] <+elevenrl> can I ask... wtf is a best of 4?
[4:04:46] <+AlphaRL_> *4-game series. round robin feeding into a single elim bracket.
[4:04:46] <Blakout> Jfro looks like he's playing one handed. Wth
[4:05:15] <TheShadeTree> Wait
[4:05:18] <TheShadeTree> "Best of 4"?
[4:05:18] <FisheySauce> Just asking... WTF IS A BO4
[4:05:22] <FisheySauce> Ikr
[4:05:24] <+elevenrl> so they're playing 4 games no matter what?
[4:05:27] <+Teroctador> @TheShadeTree same question
[4:05:28] <Conbron> something special I guess
[4:05:32] <+AlphaRL_> üëèüëèüëèüëè*4-game series. round robin feeding into a single elim bracket.
[4:05:32] <WayproteinRL> you play 4 games and just take the record from that
[4:05:38] <Blakout> @FisheySauce College Math, man

[4:05:50] <TheShadeTree> Best of cos(4)
[4:05:50] <WayproteinRL> you get 3 points for a 4-0 or 3-1 and 1 point for a 2-2
[4:05:51] <+sleepymtn> @elevenrl ya, you get 3 points for winning the series and 1 point for a tie I believe
[4:05:53] <FisheySauce> OH like at gold rush?
[4:06:05] <+sleepymtn> @Cryo_RL Apache in the hat closest to camera
[4:06:19] <Cryo_RL> Thanks

[4:06:29] <Cryo_RL> I want them to win
[4:06:31] <graeveboat> yes @elevenrl, winner gets 3. tie is 1, and 0 for a loss. similar to soccer
[4:06:32] <Cespinosa1520> Apache is the one on the right with the hat
[4:06:41] <Cryo_RL> He‚Äôs a nice dude
[4:06:42] <WayproteinRL> single elim bracket is bo5 semis and bo7 finals

[4:12:36] <Cryo_RL> UTD gives them so much space to do what they want

[4:13:17] <Conbron> it's easy to say that watching on the sideline my friend
[4:13:20] <Cryo_RL> There‚Äôs only 4 teams?
[4:13:29] <+AlphaRL_> yeah

[4:15:39] <FisheySauce> some teams do
[4:15:47] <+AlphaRL_> UTD?
[4:15:55] <+AlphaRL_> don't think so, but idk
[4:16:05] <Conbron> well they're doing pretty well
[4:16:15] <FisheySauce> yeah... they're not all GC, some might even just be champ 1 or something
[4:16:17] <Cryo_RL> I‚Äôm taking credit for A&M
[4:16:29] <Monsieur_Papadopoulos> best of 4?? DansGame
[4:16:32] <Conbron> they're playing really well for not being a gc stacked team

[4:24:17] <Conbron> like ut in tennis sounds for every time you touch the ball
[4:24:25] <Cryo_RL> @claven no worries
[4:24:51] <FisheySauce> I want A&M to just pop off
[4:25:02] <Conbron> when you score you get the meme horn

[4:28:19] <you_are_a_big_guy> his apache sounds like paschy
[4:29:16] <ronaldbolado> 600 viewers wtf
[4:29:20] <ronaldbolado> why so little viewers
[4:29:25] <Monsieur_Papadopoulos> savage score
[4:29:30] <Conbron> was at 1k when I started watching
[4:29:31] <stresstest> Thats pretty brutal round
[4:29:44] <+DormantHades141> So little viewers because this game is so bad
[4:29:45] <Cryo_RL> Apache is their captain
[4:29:47] <+slaverealms> its lunchtime
[4:30:16] <+sleepymtn> It was 2.5k earlier today
[4:30:26] <+sleepymtn> 2,5k*
[4:30:29] <Cryo_RL> Man their getting outpaced
[4:30:41] <Dust_RL> I wonder how they got GC.
[4:30:52] <Conbron> well gc stacked team vs champ team? likely to happen
[4:30:56] <Cryo_RL> UTD needs to position better. 2 guys always sit on the goal line
[4:31:01] <mechwd> Wow... UTD isnt even trying right now
[4:31:06] <+AlphaRL_> wasnt hard in season 3
[4:31:14] <Conbron> don't count season 3
[4:31:19] <Conbron> should say that
[4:31:22] <Dust_RL> i dont mean season 3
[4:31:24] <Tacticalbox> GC can have huge gaps in skill though
[4:31:33] <Cryo_RL> You count season 3 if you get it early
[4:31:39] <Cryo_RL> A lot o people didnt
[4:31:51] <Conbron> true, but they can play at a fast pace better than champs
[4:32:02] <alohasnackbarsa> DAMNNNNN
[4:32:18] <Dust_RL> The whiffs a hilarious for season 6&7 "gc" xD
[4:32:40] <Conbron> Happens to everyone
[4:32:51] <Conbron> especially when you rubber band

[5:17:03] <NAZTY187> One shot is trash
[5:18:00] <InnocentSamsoee> turn down for ingame volume, way 2 high compared to commentary.
[5:18:19] <Narwhalien> those crowd sounds, were they real? sounded like way more people than I expected
[5:18:48] <Narwhalien> @innocentsamsoee agreed
[5:19:52] <NAZTY187> Whoever wins this better not get a dreamhack title
[5:20:26] <+skelonightz> i dont think they will
[5:20:34] <+skelonightz> i went to a smaller dreamhack, the winner there didn't
[5:20:39] <+doinsumwork_jr> Theyre trash wtf
[5:20:41] <+AlwaysUnreal> This is like watching any Diamond 3's game
[5:20:45] <+Bumney> My man ninja casting!!!
[5:20:49] <+skelonightz> i wouldnt go to that extent
[5:20:53] <+skelonightz> it looks slower on stream
[5:21:00] <+skelonightz> it always does
[5:21:10] <+AlwaysUnreal> I mean, I play Rocket League
[5:21:21] <+Bumney> Texas is C#3-GC I believe
[5:21:23] <+skelonightz> wow me 2
[5:21:24] <+doinsumwork_jr> Ya
[5:21:29] <+skelonightz> it still looks slower on stream
[5:21:30] <+Bumney> C3-GC
[5:21:32] <+doinsumwork_jr> They miss a lot
[5:21:49] <+doinsumwork_jr> Highkey
[5:21:56] <+AlwaysUnreal> It's just real sloppy
[5:21:58] <+skelonightz> they arent pros what do u expect lol
[5:22:03] <+skelonightz> they wont be as coordinated
[5:22:12] <Narwhalien> It's no rlcs but not d3 lol
[5:22:19] <Pyre> Lotta spaghetti playing live
[5:22:21] <+9hyd> Yeah UT is two GCs and a C3
[5:22:24] <+doinsumwork_jr> How are 3 of them grand champ
[5:22:32] <+Bumney> This is the biggest stage they have been on before, probably a lot of stress
[5:22:52] <+Freerunnerx10> Lan shakes are a thing
[5:22:53] <Narwhalien> How many people are in thr
[5:23:04] <+Bumney> UNT and UT are they best that are there
[5:23:05] <Narwhalien> crowd*?
[5:23:17] <+AlwaysUnreal> These are the best two teams??
[5:23:23] <+AlwaysUnreal> Oh UNT
[5:23:24] <+AlwaysUnreal> nvm
[5:23:31] <+impootinlikevladimir> I think people are undermining the effect of playing on a stage infront of ppl
[5:23:37] <jluv22> jfroooo
[5:23:38] <+9hyd> Top seed and bottom seed
[5:23:47] <mazi_love6> What is the price pool?
[5:23:52] <DanStartsFires> Try uploading a diamond 3 game to youtube. People will say "How is this D#? it looks like plat 2." People always think it looks lower skill than it actually is
[5:24:05] <DanStartsFires> But if anyone played these guys at d3 they would get wrecked 10-0
[5:24:26] <Narwhalien> but all play players are gcs stuck in plqt
[5:24:28] <+Jithins> hmmm

[5:25:53] <DanStartsFires> Some guy even did a study on it. He showed people RL gameplay and had them guess what rank it was. Almost every time people guessed 2-3 ranks lower than it was
[5:25:57] <+Freerunnerx10> Don't do that bad advice... go for water LUL
[5:25:59] <+rcf_whale> Loco time?
[5:26:19] <wabo98> Time to crack a cold one

[5:30:36] <+impootinlikevladimir> thats a pretty decent play
[5:30:43] <jluv22> jfrooooo
[5:31:05] <+rcf_whale> Damnnnnn
[5:31:57] <+9hyd> Blade is the solution
[5:32:06] <mechwd> I love how these announcers are acting like everything they do (outside clear mistakes) are on purpose. You know half this crap is on accident.
[5:33:03] <+d3vinchy> ehhhh if they are gcs i say that there are a lot of calculated play
[5:33:10] <DanStartsFires> ^
[5:33:30] <mechwd> I would believe that, but all these missed easy shots, and overshooting the ball make me not believe it
[5:33:34] <+Raighar> PowerUpL xrdblaDe PowerUpR
[5:33:39] <Phi_Sig> Okay...
[5:33:45] <+9hyd> xrdblaDe xrdblaDe xrdblaDe
[5:33:46] <+AlwaysUnreal> I feel like the "slow down" play in the corner was def a mistake
[5:33:50] <mechwd> ^
[5:34:09] <+AlwaysUnreal> If it was on purpose, it was just a sloppy looking slow down
[5:34:15] <+llungs> utd is trash, biased com
[5:34:35] <+d3vinchy> playing around that level about everything you do has to be what you plan too. You cant just hit the ball and hope. Like where you hit it at definitly depends on the next play
[5:34:43] <+slaverealms> blade sub btw Kreygasm Kreygasm
