[2:26:18] <thefruityloop> i am scared xD
[2:26:32] <thefruityloop> ok
[2:26:32] <%Aerodaimannic> xD
[2:26:36] <Vicksy> a huge part of playing league is confidence in yourself imo
[2:26:48] <thefruityloop> ah see heres my story vicksy
[2:27:11] <thefruityloop> new and playing ranked first time. learning support. no CLUE what i need to do or anything on how to play a real league game
[2:27:28] <Vicksy> oh you're new? didn't know :P
[2:27:39] <thefruityloop> well i played in season 1/2 quit until now
[2:28:03] <Vicksy> comet isn't guaranteed to hit unless you hit q
[2:28:11] <Vicksy> so aery is nice, and it passes shields over too later on

[2:28:47] <Vicksy> im the same lol
[2:28:57] <Vicksy> i cant auto legit
[2:29:00] <Vicksy> i always walk into enemy team
[2:29:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[2:30:07] <thefruityloop> ok so play more aggressively always?
[2:30:27] <thefruityloop> problem with bronze is jungler doesnt come often
[2:30:35] <Vicksy> being aggressive is always beneficial in league, only issue is you need to worry about other people, so remember to ward consistently
[2:30:38] <@Imperator_Draconis> only if they cant punish you for it
[2:30:42] <thefruityloop> ok

[2:32:28] <Vicksy> but its a heal force
[2:33:11] <Vicksy> also another big thing is lux started with faery charm
[2:33:14] <Vicksy> = no potions
[2:33:20] <Vicksy> so you should 100% win the sustain war

[2:40:31] <@Voyde> o/
[2:40:41] <jfiedff> hi everyone^^
[2:40:50] <thefruityloop> THIS game is really bad. im good with stopping. this wasnt a good game for me at all. i feel like any other game wouldve been better to watch
[2:41:02] <thefruityloop> ok
[2:41:30] <@nadinxo> too much for my little heart to handle
[2:41:34] <thefruityloop> i mean i need to hear the mistakes but NOT this game
[2:41:44] <@Voyde> lul
[2:41:47] <thefruityloop> xD
[2:41:59] <xScarletDragonx> Tbh
[2:42:03] <xScarletDragonx> bad games are the best to learn from
[2:42:06] <+mslux> ^
[2:42:25] <thefruityloop> thats true but i wasn't focused due to husband as i said earlier xD
[2:42:28] <%Aerodaimannic> Yeah fruity don't worry it's all good :)
[2:42:30] <xScarletDragonx> it sucks seeing them again but if you can get past it and study what you did wrong theres a lot of improvement that can happen
[2:42:34] <xScarletDragonx> dont stress about it <3
[2:42:35] <thefruityloop> nah its fine its fine go
[2:43:12] <thefruityloop> im not im just tryin to say this game was bad because i wasn't focused like normal but i guess that means its the perfect one to do :) so no worries lets go.

[2:44:46] <$AngryCossackUA> the best way to learn is to play against more skilled opponents or watching bizzle, things that work in plat, don't work in silver
[2:45:31] <+mslux> lux has tp exhaust??
[2:45:36] <thefruityloop> yeah i just got totally embarrassed cuz thats how i am. im super shy irl and it seems in game BUT if this helps me climb then lets go :)

[2:47:41] <thefruityloop> k i was wrong he came
[2:48:08] <thefruityloop> ok so watching this it seems i play to "scared".

[2:53:32] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[2:54:10] <thefruityloop> yeah bot lane is intense. and so confusing when u have no idea how to properly play xD

[2:54:41] <%LilDisvstxr> between the eyes
[2:54:46] <thefruityloop> ^
[2:54:54] <thefruityloop> ah so mobi boots over the sorc?
[2:55:02] <+ercuadrado> WutFace
[2:55:10] <thefruityloop> yeah laning phase is FOREVER because ive been told to sit and let adc farm
[2:55:18] <Fictitious1267> yeah, aggression is a big issue in my experience too
[2:55:35] <thefruityloop> im serious that is literally what ive thought
[2:55:48] <%LilDisvstxr> Roam mid
[2:55:50] <thefruityloop> thats another reason why im passive
[2:55:50] <%LilDisvstxr> help jnglr
[2:56:00] <thefruityloop> i just sit and let them farm and protect
[2:56:03] <thefruityloop> ok
[2:57:18] <thefruityloop> ok i never thought of it that way
[2:57:26] <thefruityloop> thanks!
[2:57:33] <$AngryCossackUA> hashOmg
[2:58:11] <uksupportfeeder> 99 LP REEEEEEEEE
[2:58:28] <thefruityloop> you've opened up my mind its insane....ive literally thought the supp was suppose to just "protect" while the adc farms and then like do all i can to make sure they don't die. i never thought the supp controls the lane like that

[2:58:56] <$AngryCossackUA> friendly reminder, chatm that this is difficult to react quickly and think what to do during game, you just need to play more to know it.
[2:59:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle's Socials Twitter: https://twitter.com/bizzleberrylol Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/bizzleberry
[2:59:34] <%LilDisvstxr> league is really just trial and error trial and error trial and error x30
[3:00:15] <thefruityloop> yeah in bronze no one knows exactly what to do or how to play except a short few. so everyone just runs around farming and getting kills til late game then its a coin toss on who barons/aces/wins
[3:00:46] <%LilDisvstxr> exactly that, bronze is just a cage full of monkeys being tamed by a lion
[3:00:52] <thefruityloop> ^
[3:00:52] <%LilDisvstxr> till plat imo
[3:01:08] <$AngryCossackUA> plat is worse
[3:01:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[3:01:44] <thefruityloop> i dont remember what we were doing
[3:01:47] <%LilDisvstxr> yes ive heard , how is that? currently silver 1 but i feel like ive been through the worst already :(
[3:02:29] <$AngryCossackUA> plat is silver with diamond ego, flamers and afk's every match
[3:02:48] <thefruityloop> so do we always stay in bot lane when our tower is still alive or roam or what?
[3:02:53] <%LilDisvstxr> PepeHands MORE AFKERS? NooOOoooO PepeHands
[3:02:58] <uksupportfeeder> Alright chill out guys, every elo sucks
[3:03:04] <%LilDisvstxr> i have nothing against flamers, but afk is the worst
[3:03:05] <$AngryCossackUA> but if everybody plays their mains, you can enjoy the game and win easy

[3:03:41] <$AngryCossackUA> but still it's like a flipcoin
[3:03:58] <%LilDisvstxr> i love this game <3 :'(
[3:04:10] <Synfralidro> i think they are doing fine staying bot, it's keeping 2 people away from the rest of the team
[3:04:28] <thefruityloop> it goes chaotic because there are pings everywhere later on and everyone gets confused and starts fighting in chat...at that point im so lost as to what to do i honsstly dont remember what i do.
[3:04:39] <thefruityloop> late game i mean
[3:06:02] <TheKevali> PogChamp BIZZLE BERRY PogChamp
[3:06:05] <thefruityloop> ok
[3:06:20] <thefruityloop> so basically i need to be more aggressive when i get help
[3:06:28] <TheKevali> Do you like my consistent 4-8 viewer hosts Keepo
[3:06:36] <Fictitious1267> i make that mistake too. thinking that if i move in they will know a gank is coming
[3:06:45] <thefruityloop> ya
[3:07:25] <uksupportfeeder> That's why you need to be somewhat aggressive all game, if you stand under tower for 15 minutes then walk forward , they know a gank is coming
[3:07:29] <@Nightbot> Bizzle's Socials Twitter: https://twitter.com/bizzleberrylol Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/bizzleberry
[3:07:35] <%LilDisvstxr> i often bluff in such situations whenever my q or stun is on cd, works very well
[3:07:43] <thefruityloop> ok so i need to be more aggressive and protect my team more and back off when needed
[3:07:44] <YasuTwentyTwo> Oh. I'm here. o/
[3:07:51] <uksupportfeeder> if youre constantly threatening them but not dying, when a gank comes its less obvious
[3:07:51] <TheKevali> we speccing the morg?
[3:07:55] <thefruityloop> yea
[3:08:04] <thefruityloop> new to ranked and support :S
[3:08:09] <Fictitious1267> make sense. i'm usually pretty aggressive
[3:08:09] <TheKevali> That explains why looking at Lux felt weird Kappa
[3:08:14] <thefruityloop> XD
[3:08:16] <YasuTwentyTwo> fruity is this you?
[3:08:19] <thefruityloop> yeah :(
[3:08:25] <thefruityloop> but i need the help so
[3:09:00] <thefruityloop> ok so ive also been told to always stay with adc no matter what.....
[3:09:02] <Fictitious1267> i had a game like this yesterday. i switched to support my mid
[3:09:04] <YasuTwentyTwo> Cool. Hope you can learn from this.
[3:09:14] <thefruityloop> i am so far
[3:09:26] <thefruityloop> im playing too chicken ;) and too aggressive in the wrong times
[3:09:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[3:09:54] <uksupportfeeder> don't take away 'be more aggressive'
[3:10:01] <uksupportfeeder> take away, why and when to be aggressive
[3:10:56] <thefruityloop> ok. i usually always give the kills to adc XD
[3:10:56] <%LilDisvstxr> free baroooonnn
[3:11:09] <YasuTwentyTwo> I used too. Then I started playing Brand.
[3:11:17] <thefruityloop> i play brand/morg/zyra
[3:11:33] <Synfralidro> @Bizzleberry problem is the person who does the most damage on the team is veigar, that baron attempt will take ages.
[3:11:36] <thefruityloop> thats bronze for ya no one goes for it at right times XD even i dont know when you should
[3:11:49] <thefruityloop> ok
[3:11:56] <Fictitious1267> especially if their jungle is dead
[3:12:01] <thefruityloop> true
[3:12:11] <YasuTwentyTwo> What Bronze is this?
[3:12:14] <%LilDisvstxr> 4
[3:12:14] <thefruityloop> 4
[3:12:17] <YasuTwentyTwo> Oh okay.
[3:12:21] <TheKevali> We can't see where you hand points Berry Keepo
[3:12:29] <YasuTwentyTwo> In MY bronze we Baron even if it's super dumb.
[3:12:30] <thefruityloop> ?
[3:12:40] <thefruityloop> ok
[3:12:49] <$AngryCossackUA> league of kadeem elo KappaHD TriHard
[3:13:11] <YasuTwentyTwo> What rank is Kadeem?
[3:13:26] <$AngryCossackUA> b4 i guess, he climbed recently
[3:13:32] <%LilDisvstxr> thats the thing, i can go 24/4 on katarina, ace the enemy team and then lose turrets beacuse my team doesnt push any lanes, clear any wave or defend any turret, fckin frustrating. anyone tips for 1 v 5

[3:33:56] <thefruityloop> i am lost yeah
[3:34:43] <thefruityloop> i told u. bronze = chasing for kills who cares about objectives.
[3:35:04] <thefruityloop> ok
[3:35:53] <thefruityloop> IDK WHAT IM DOING XD
[3:36:05] <KaitoRoka> ^me in every game lol
[3:36:09] <thefruityloop> haha right
[3:36:11] <BrotherFrosty> lol same
[3:36:12] <KaitoRoka> i never know what im doing xD
[3:36:51] <amrluca> this graves is always farming bot lane
[3:36:58] <thefruityloop> yeah he is
[3:37:09] <thefruityloop> that game all he said was "push and farm"
[3:37:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[3:37:50] <thefruityloop> LOL
[3:37:54] <thefruityloop> idiots.
[3:38:03] <thefruityloop> we're all idiots xD
[3:38:23] <%n0madbeard> lux has looked fairly decent this game
[3:38:39] <thefruityloop> yep
[3:38:44] <thefruityloop> yeah its over
[3:38:55] <%Aerodaimannic> You played well fruity. Some really good bindings!
[3:39:02] <thefruityloop> thanks ;)
[3:39:17] <thefruityloop> i just need to be more aggressive in times and not aggressive in times
[3:39:28] <thefruityloop> also need to buy more control wards and build different
[3:39:44] <%Aerodaimannic> I'm a terrible adc so I respect you support mains for trying your best to help noobs like me xD
[3:39:50] <thefruityloop> XD
[3:39:59] <%cookies4u> <3
[3:40:14] <thefruityloop> so do i leave adc alone then??
[3:40:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle's Socials Twitter: https://twitter.com/bizzleberrylol Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/bizzleberry
[3:40:38] <thefruityloop> no no when u said protect mid lane
[3:40:40] <thefruityloop> ok
[3:40:42] <thefruityloop> got it
[3:40:58] <%LilDisvstxr> if your lane is pushing, you can go mid or jngl if u want, just do what feels right
[3:41:09] <%LilDisvstxr> most of the times your guts are your guidance
[3:41:31] <thefruityloop> thanks alot for the review i learned alot
[3:41:31] <xScarletDragonx> I remember bizzle saying you sat in base and took 2 long to buy often, you could try looking up guides for champions and making item sets for them, helps people be able to buy quicker and makes it easier to think "Do I need this over that or would x be better for this match-up"
[3:41:41] <%n0madbeard> not if you eat kfc though, then your guts will be all messed up
[3:41:43] <%Aerodaimannic> Someone used to say you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. So just go for it :D
[3:41:59] <amrluca> -mj
[3:42:01] <thefruityloop> ok
[3:42:22] <YasuTwentyTwo> I take Aery on Brand.

[3:45:54] <%n0madbeard> @xScarletDragonx agreed with you dude, not sure why people buy reviews on some channels
[3:46:18] <%LilDisvstxr> do you prefer support role? or are others lane fine too to review?
[3:46:21] <boki262> i prommise if u analize my game i will sub u <3
[3:46:26] <amrluca> what ranks do you review?
[3:46:31] <@Imperator_Draconis> watch the laning phase guide of bizzle if you got A LOT OF TIME LUL @thefruityloop
[3:46:37] <boki262> i rly like that u tell adn explain when u play what u do
[3:46:43] <xScarletDragonx> @n0madbeard Yeah, and its so overpriced as well. its ridiculous lol
[3:46:48] <@Imperator_Draconis> wait a sec i get the link
[3:47:02] <xScarletDragonx> A good way to work on aggression is just play some norms and aim to be as aggro as possible, learn what you can and cant get away with, push the boundaries
[3:47:11] <@Imperator_Draconis> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6RIugng4rE
[3:47:22] <boki262> yeye np i will send u the link tomrow
[3:47:23] <xScarletDragonx> Can always just say to your team that your trying to improve your aggression so they know your gonna be playing that way
[3:47:43] <thefruityloop> thanks so much. i dont spend $$ on subs but if i did i would totally sub to you in a thanks but my husband would kill me........ "its just a game" to him XD but you are amazing thank u so much
[3:47:49] <YasuTwentyTwo> You gonna solo que? More of this? Do you know when Pyke is gonna come out?
[3:48:12] <boki262> i understand
[3:48:21] <xScarletDragonx> @Bizzleberry we were talking about reviewers who dont give constructive feedback and just are very negative about the person theyre reviewing :x
[3:48:29] <@Voyde> Once I get my pc back I can sort a form on discord for people to fill out. unless one of the other mods wants to do it
[3:48:30] <%LilDisvstxr> @YasuTwentyTwo i think he comes tomorrow with the patch
[3:48:32] <%n0madbeard> oh i completely agree, it is worth it but some of the streamers aren't really constructive mostly derogatory
[3:48:45] <YasuTwentyTwo> tomorrow? D:

[4:32:40] <+ercuadrado> do you play Pyke in pbe?
[4:32:57] <%thefruityloop> what do u mean when u say "freezing lane" what is that?
[4:33:14] <@Imperator_Draconis> the minion waves stay at the same place
[4:33:26] <%n0madbeard> @thefruityloop freezing the lane is when you balance the minion wave so it doesn't move
[4:33:31] <+Chewbaccaw> what am i doing on shaco NotLikeThis

[4:33:35] <%thefruityloop> ahhh ok
[4:33:48] <%thefruityloop> why and when do u need to freeze?
[4:33:54] <Odddwaffle> MY internet is bad today, too many kids off school and on youtube :)
[4:34:01] <%n0madbeard> you look to do it to farm safely
[4:34:18] <+Chewbaccaw> u know in these cases
[4:34:21] <+Chewbaccaw> i would just rush a mobi's
[4:34:22] <%thefruityloop> how do u do that safely
[4:34:22] <%n0madbeard> if you are farming naturally the minion wave will push to you opponent
[4:35:08] <%n0madbeard> however if you have more enemy minions than friendly, then the wave stays in place with you last hitting
[4:35:23] <%swooperlicious> @thefruityloop lotta cases: if you can zone them away from farm, you freeze to deny them farm, or if you're scared of their jung and want to keep wave close to your tower
[4:35:26] <@Imperator_Draconis> yeah thats kinda how my second game today went LUL
[4:35:42] <%thefruityloop> ok
[4:35:47] <%n0madbeard> it's a little difficult to explain but if you only last hit, you can keep the wave in place if there are 3 more enemy minions than friendly
[4:36:57] <%n0madbeard> LUL nice
[4:37:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[4:37:39] <@Imperator_Draconis> why would they risk a fight, as long they dont feed you its a sure win for them
[4:37:59] <@Imperator_Draconis> 2v2*
[4:38:00] <%thefruityloop> o.o
[4:38:17] <+Chewbaccaw> u know when i versus a draven i always like garenteed/comfort picks
[4:38:21] <+Chewbaccaw> i love to play tahm vs draven
[4:38:29] <+Chewbaccaw> legit can 1v1 him pre six

[4:38:34] <@Nightbot> I will review some games. Leave your details in !discord #league channel.
[4:38:40] <+Chewbaccaw> but after draven gets that first kill, you cannot 1v1 him anymore

[4:39:12] <BrotherFrosty> if you guys make it to 15
[4:39:21] <%n0madbeard> i hate people asking for ff like camille
[4:39:26] <%thefruityloop> i have a question: If you are losing lane and your bot tower falls but theirs doesnt and the enemy bot lane roams around: what do u do?
[4:39:29] <@Imperator_Draconis> !ff
[4:39:29] <@Nightbot> again bizzle?
[4:39:41] <BrotherFrosty> i would fight this to the end though
[4:39:46] <%swooperlicious> u got the minion tho
[4:40:19] <%HolySampsonite> Lol that open mid though
[4:40:22] <BrotherFrosty> you guys are back!

[4:40:33] <%cookies4u> euw open :)
[4:40:51] <BrotherFrosty> unfortunate
[4:41:21] <%n0madbeard> @thefruityloop if opponents roam, they will miss farm, if they move to top lane for instance, you'll need to follow them as they will beat your toplaner 2v1
[4:41:41] <+Chewbaccaw> or if drag is up
[4:41:42] <+Chewbaccaw> do drag
[4:41:47] <%n0madbeard> if they are just roaming around though, they are wasting time
[4:42:07] <+Chewbaccaw> but n0mad if they are lvl 6 and a suppor they arnt wasting time
[4:42:09] <%thefruityloop> in a bronze game they dont do that. they go mid or just lurk around and kill everyone in jg etc. so then what ?
[4:42:10] <+Chewbaccaw> 🤔
[4:42:15] <BrotherFrosty> agreed, you guys had it, it could be a winnable game
[4:42:16] <%n0madbeard> lol
[4:42:22] <BrotherFrosty> imo
[4:42:26] <+Chewbaccaw> im serious tho
[4:42:27] <%n0madbeard> maybe you can tilt the other team
[4:42:32] <+Chewbaccaw> all a suppor technically needs is lvl 6

[4:53:18] <BrotherFrosty> does aery increase black shield shield?
[4:53:30] <YasuTwentyTwo> No. It gives you a real shield.
[4:53:34] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[4:53:42] <YasuTwentyTwo> So you get the magic shield. then true shield.
[4:53:51] <BrotherFrosty> oh thats cool
[4:54:18] <YasuTwentyTwo> I think it's Aery.
[4:54:24] <%n0madbeard> what does lulu mid actually build?
[4:54:29] <BrotherFrosty> that would be the best case

[4:55:00] <+mikegronstal> so would any shield increasing items increase the size of morg's spellshield?
[4:55:00] <%n0madbeard> ardent? that would atleast be useful with sivir later
[4:55:16] <BrotherFrosty> what do you have down resolve, bone plating and ..?
[4:55:19] <YasuTwentyTwo> I think Black shield takes the magic damage and Aery takes the damage that magic shield can't block? :Thinking:
[4:55:30] <$AngryCossackUA> almost reported my adc for not giving me honour but he gave in the last moment. painlessLUL
[4:56:10] <@Imperator_Draconis> nah you rush banner on lulu mid against an ap laner, it literlay removes them from the game
[4:56:36] <%n0madbeard> ahh.. yeah, i can imagine that @Imperator_Draconis
[4:56:38] <BrotherFrosty> whoa, you guys are poking them down
[4:56:45] <BrotherFrosty> nobody saw this coming
[4:56:52] <YasuTwentyTwo> I like Aery on Brand.
[4:56:58] <%saoisu> aw i wish i had a game to be reviewed, fingers crossed my internet allows ranked again now i'm moved xD
[4:57:04] <BrotherFrosty> over the damage from Arcane
[4:57:42] <YasuTwentyTwo> If I'm not mistaken. Comet can be dodged, and takes longer to reset.
[4:57:45] <%n0madbeard> @BrotherFrosty have you played many games with both? because you can look up the stats and see what dmg each keystone does
[4:57:55] <YasuTwentyTwo> With Brand burn I can sometimes get Aery to smack them twice.

[5:14:34] <+Chewbaccaw> Alistar is rough at times
[5:14:34] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[5:14:38] <%thefruityloop> yeah
[5:14:46] <+Chewbaccaw> the hardest tank in the game tbh
[5:14:55] <+Chewbaccaw> there are 7 combos with his Q and W
[5:14:57] <%thefruityloop> i dont play him often but sometimes braum is banned so i pick him
[5:15:23] <%thefruityloop> only when i need to be a tank
[5:15:31] <$AngryCossackUA> painlessLUL
[5:15:33] <%thefruityloop> so who is better tank to play if braum is banned?

[5:15:37] <%thefruityloop> for low elo
[5:15:38] <+Chewbaccaw> alistar
[5:15:40] <+Chewbaccaw> oh
[5:15:42] <+Chewbaccaw> Thresh
[5:15:48] <%thefruityloop> ah ok
[5:15:53] <+Chewbaccaw> Thresh gives u decent follow up and playmaking potential
[5:15:58] <%n0madbeard> i would suggest taric as a safe tank
[5:16:06] <+Chewbaccaw> many low elo players will not expect a flash play from alistar or a simple w q combo from alistar
[5:16:12] <+Chewbaccaw> taric is great
[5:16:16] <%thefruityloop> id have to practice taric
[5:16:19] <+Chewbaccaw> but u need to have foresight into when popping his ult
[5:16:21] <%thefruityloop> havent played him much at all
[5:16:32] <@Nightbot> Bizzle's Socials Twitter: https://twitter.com/bizzleberrylol Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/bizzleberry
[5:16:41] <+Chewbaccaw> the difference in tarics of what ive seen is they do not have foresight or know what the enemy can do
[5:16:43] <%thefruityloop> what is blitz? tank? utility?
[5:16:48] <+Chewbaccaw> Tank
[5:17:00] <+Chewbaccaw> Blitz has the same concept of morgana Q
[5:17:08] <+Chewbaccaw> hold onto it and walk into them LUL
[5:17:16] <%thefruityloop> so if no braum is blitz the better choice?
[5:17:20] <+Chewbaccaw> depends
[5:17:24] <%thefruityloop> or thresh as u said
[5:17:41] <+Chewbaccaw> if the team has an alistar/thresh/rammus anything really that needs to gap close to release cc = bad to pick blitz in
[5:17:49] <%thefruityloop> ok
[5:17:54] <BrotherFrosty> beautiful q again, Bizzle, damn
[5:18:00] <+Chewbaccaw> so u dont wanna pick blitz into any melee cc'ers
[5:18:03] <+Chewbaccaw> thats just a bad time LUL
[5:18:08] <%thefruityloop> got ya ok thx
[5:18:26] <+Chewbaccaw> with taric its different tho
[5:18:29] <+Chewbaccaw> gotta land that E in lane
[5:18:32] <+Chewbaccaw> or u will lose trades
[5:18:47] <FrittiTailchaser> That Trundle seems to be doing a good job overall
[5:19:01] <+Chewbaccaw> have foresight in all aspects of play
[5:19:07] <+Chewbaccaw> harassing, skirmishing, teamfighting
[5:19:12] <BrotherFrosty> fiora has a banner minion there
[5:19:13] <%thefruityloop> ok
[5:19:15] <BrotherFrosty> gg
[5:19:20] <+Chewbaccaw> look for animations of champions ults for optimal ult use
[5:19:48] <BrotherFrosty> blue gives you gold?
[5:19:52] <catachan1brainleaf> never got an alert you were on man . how`s things ppl
[5:19:54] <+Chewbaccaw> if u see a thresh land a hook and go in when your team is grouped vs there other team, it is best to follow that up with a taric ult
[5:20:16] <%n0madbeard> doing good @catachan1brainleaf
[5:20:17] <%saoisu> omg i got an arm for my monitor and lowered my desk a few cm and it feels so much better
[5:20:17] <+Chewbaccaw> gotta have reaction time with taric to make full useo f his ult
[5:20:23] <%n0madbeard> Bizzle in d2 promors
[5:20:35] <%thefruityloop> ill have to try him out in norms awhile
[5:20:43] <%n0madbeard> gg
[5:20:48] <+Chewbaccaw> dont fall for his looks fruity KappaPride
[5:20:50] <catachan1brainleaf> good stuff man :)

[5:21:55] <%thefruityloop> @Bizzleberry another question (so sorry to bombard u all the time) but when do u play a different type of supp? how do u know which to play i mean? aka a utility or a mage etc if my question makes any sense at all....i obviously know when i need to tank
[5:22:20] <%thefruityloop> its ok :) thats why i re posted
[5:22:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle's Socials Twitter: https://twitter.com/bizzleberrylol Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/bizzleberry

[5:22:33] <%thefruityloop> oh no :o
[5:22:42] <%thefruityloop> i didnt know there was one ok thanks
[5:22:46] <~Bizzleberry> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlHgjvBLE4U
[5:22:47] <+Odixce> Mages beat tanks, Tanks beat hard engage, hard engage beats mage
[5:22:57] <%thefruityloop> awesome ty!
[5:23:07] <%n0madbeard> DansGame just seen the new world cup skins for rammus and lee sin.. yuck
[5:23:22] <%n0madbeard> dark star cho looks awesome though

[5:23:40] <+Chewbaccaw> doesnt counter alistar if the alistar plays it correctly
[5:23:46] <+Odixce> Well yeah, like Leona counts as "tank" and hard engage
[5:23:48] <%n0madbeard> maybe it'll grow on me @FrittiTailchaser
[5:23:59] <+Odixce> so its not black and white
[5:24:16] <%saoisu> zyra, nami or afk Kappa
[5:24:20] <+InsertCoin2Continue> ivern
[5:24:21] <%thefruityloop> lol
[5:24:35] <catachan1brainleaf> adc changes things as well i think
[5:24:37] <%SuperNeclord> Kai'sa is my go to ban
[5:24:53] <+Chewbaccaw> alistar into morgana matchup is a sustained battle, becuz what the morg needs to do is disengage effectivley and the alistar needs to pursue offense effectivly I.E dodging Morgs Q's while also trying to stay on top of morgana or whoever is black shielded
[5:24:54] <%n0madbeard> could be the adc banning braum
[5:25:07] <%n0madbeard> noe
[5:25:35] <%n0madbeard> early game will be rough
[5:25:37] <%saoisu> Namiiiii

[5:25:50] <BrotherFrosty> you have a kog too, Nami is real good here
[5:25:51] <+Odixce> I'd say Nami just to counter the Jhin ult
[5:26:17] <~Bizzleberry> nami or lulu
[5:26:18] <%saoisu> Does anyone have a nami emote?
[5:26:19] <%SuperNeclord> Nami
[5:26:20] <%thefruityloop> nami

[5:28:49] <+Chewbaccaw> u went spellthiefs WutFace
[5:28:52] <%thefruityloop> so i was vs an ap blitz the other day O.o then in another an ADC blitz who went pure adc/attack speet O.o the heck?
[5:28:52] <BrotherFrosty> nobody picks Kog when you cant see 4 of their picks
[5:29:11] <BrotherFrosty> this is the best Kog EU (nordic east), i can tell
[5:29:16] <%saoisu> AP blitz is an aram classic and it is awful to play against xD
[5:29:27] <%saoisu> when i try it i just miss all hooks
[5:29:31] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[5:29:54] <%saoisu> What if he just endlessly holds his hook? I hate that
[5:30:09] <BrotherFrosty> blitz q cdr is low though right, relatively low, like morg q
[5:30:24] <%saoisu> long enough to trade back though
[5:31:11] <BrotherFrosty> but just short trade, use abilities and back off, reset
[5:31:14] <@Imperator_Draconis> so how did last game go? had dinner NomNom

[5:34:26] <WynningBlodtann> Ugh, was waiting for a better time to ask this, but is Scorch really worth it? When playing Nami (and revieving the total amount it does each game)it feels like the damage it does is negible in the long run, compared to Gathering storm.
[5:34:28] <+Odixce> Noct putting in work
[5:34:31] <+GaliMathias_> Where is bizzle from?
[5:34:33] <%n0madbeard> well at least blitz got the kill and jhin didn't get anything

[5:35:40] <%n0madbeard> @saoisu you can do a ping test before you start
[5:36:04] <@Imperator_Draconis> @n0madbeard too late shes already in game
[5:36:11] <%saoisu> yeah but i've been having questionable ping spikes at my old place, wouldn't necessarily happen as i checked
[5:36:14] <%n0madbeard> oh well
[5:36:29] <%n0madbeard> ahhh ok
[5:36:36] <%saoisu> i got jinx, v little chance i'm winning this :^)

[5:38:27] <%SuperNeclord> It is kinda absurd how much people rage at this game
[5:38:40] <%n0madbeard> it is so hard to keep players from tilting.. it's literally as important as you champ mechanics some times
[5:39:02] <YasuTwentyTwo> I had a game where my entire team was fighting the whole game.
[5:39:15] <YasuTwentyTwo> It was thanks to the enemy jungler being an asshole that we teamed up and won the game.
[5:39:38] <WynningBlodtann> people are so mad, regardless of elo
[5:39:54] <YasuTwentyTwo> Jungle said "Talon I fucking hate you, but I'd rather win this game then fight you" so then we came back and won by working together.

[6:17:52] <%SuperNeclord> Thanks dude
[6:17:56] <%SuperNeclord> That definitely helps
[6:18:38] <Fictitious1267> i get a lot out of W harass on janna
[6:18:56] <Fictitious1267> with aery and scorch
[6:19:10] <%thefruityloop> i use to play janna/sona/lulu and i swapped to morg/brand/zyra super. im also im low elo bronze
[6:20:12] <%n0madbeard> this trundle hasn't made things easy, seems to almost bait you in and then run off
[6:20:45] <%thefruityloop> imo junglers in this elo have no idea what they are suppose to do or do. kinda like all of us too
[6:20:53] <Fictitious1267> true
[6:21:08] <%SuperNeclord> Alright my dude
[6:21:18] <%SuperNeclord> Just go straight to E if we are losing lane then?
[6:21:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[6:22:19] <Fictitious1267> nice q
[6:22:30] <@Nightbot> Bizzle's Socials Twitter: https://twitter.com/bizzleberrylol Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/bizzleberry
[6:22:46] <+FogHouse> if im losing lane i just level whatever helps my adc the most
[6:22:51] <%SuperNeclord> I generally max W
[6:22:57] <%SuperNeclord> so thats my bad
[6:23:15] <Fictitious1267> i do too for the move speed

[6:23:47] <%thefruityloop> i always maxed E then the W myself but i did cuz i just thought thats just what to do cuz of the shield
[6:23:58] <%SuperNeclord> I'll definitely start doing E first
[6:24:09] <Fictitious1267> i'll try it. thx
[6:24:22] <Fictitious1267> most guides i've seen get early w
[6:24:31] <catachan1brainleaf> the slow from w is ok if you get your jungler to gank but it`s kinda wasted if you put more than a point or two in it
[6:24:37] <%swooperlicious> @Fictitious1267 theyre probably outdated
[6:24:56] <%swooperlicious> w used to be ok in a some lanes but got nerfed
[6:26:21] <+FogHouse> with a q mf was dead
[6:26:47] <%thefruityloop> aha nice Q play
[6:26:51] <bloodrush_cancer_victim> LUL
[6:26:54] <+FogHouse> great Q there
[6:27:13] <%SuperNeclord> lets ignore that ult haha
[6:27:17] <%thefruityloop> ^^
[6:28:07] <Fictitious1267> i'm pretty bad with janna ult messing up my melee teammates

[6:28:33] <+FogHouse> i always throw thwem away from my team when i shouldnt LUL
[6:28:40] <%thefruityloop> idk if its right but when my team is winning i ult behind them to where i just heal them instead of pushing the enemy away
[6:29:31] <@Nightbot> Bizzle is live everyday from 6pm UK time. On Weekends he is usually on earlier around 2pm!
[6:29:44] <%SuperNeclord> Yeah, I just straight up forget to exhaust most fights
[6:29:47] <+FogHouse> thats an option i believe @FrittiTailchaser
[6:29:59] <+FogHouse> @thefruityloop i mean
[6:30:06] <%thefruityloop> ok
[6:30:39] <%SuperNeclord> Definitely didn't know that

[6:32:00] <%thefruityloop> im meaning the eyes on top
[6:32:25] <YasuTwentyTwo> Yeah I know. I'm just saying that there is more indicators for vision plant.
[6:32:25] <%swooperlicious> you lose mvspd after you use w as well
[6:32:35] <%thefruityloop> ah got ya
[6:32:49] <%thefruityloop> lol
[6:32:53] <%SuperNeclord> I think this is the point where I just start dying a ton

[6:41:08] <catachan1brainleaf> if my adc doesn't have a death wish it normally goes ok . all you need to worry about then is your teams ego`s lol
[6:41:18] <%thefruityloop> now i understand why people play more mage supports
[6:42:43] <%SuperNeclord> I feel like my laning phase goes so much better than team fighting

[6:56:25] <+FogHouse> i like it like this. where you play some and review some
[6:56:26] <%pez1313> balanced is good tho
[6:56:28] <FrittiTailchaser> More than just a sub.
[6:56:28] <ralenation> can you do eune vods 2 ?
[6:56:33] <%kujjuaq> @z28power i agree
[6:56:38] <%thefruityloop> maybe not do a day but like 1 a day or something idk
[6:56:45] <%thefruityloop> if u do a whole day your voice will bleh
